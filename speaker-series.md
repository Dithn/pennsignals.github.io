<h2 class="blue-text text-darken-4">Predictive Healthcare Speaker Series</h2>
<h4>Sharing lessons and perspectives on successfully implementing and integrating predictive healthcare solutions</h4>

<p>
  As interest in applying the tools of data science to clinical and operational healthcare problems increases, the success of the solutions will depend on much more than the performance of a particular algorithm. 
</p>
  The Penn Medicine Predictive Healthcare speaker series aims to bring together the wide array of players from across the institution who have a stake in the successful operationalization of data science solutions in health care. The topics will encompass separate disciplines that come together to deliver these solutions, including:

<li>Computer science</li>
<li>AI/machine learning</li>
<li>Human Factors</li>
<li>Real-time and big data architectures</li>
<li>Process Improvement</li>
<li>Clinical/medical research</li>


<p>
  We hope that this speaker series and discussion forum will foster collaboration and an exchange of ideas to deliver effective predictive solutions in healthcare.
