# Jekyll Now

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

**Jekyll Now** makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.

- You don't need to touch the command line
- You don't need to install/configure ruby, rvm/rbenv, ruby gems :relaxed:
- You don't need to install runtime dependencies like markdown processors, Pygments, etc
- If you're on Windows, this will make setting up Jekyll a lot easier
- It's easy to try out, you can just delete your forked repository if you don't like it

Predictive Healthcare uses Minimal theme with Materialize framework, a modern responsive front-end framework based on Material Design.


## Quick Start


### Step 1) Customize and view your site

Site name, description, other options are set in _config.yml file. You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here too.

Making a change to _config.yml (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at <http://yourgithubusername.github.io> - if not, give it ten minutes as GitHub suggests and it'll appear soon



### Step 2) Add blog post

Add a new .md file under _posts directory. i.e.: `/_posts/2014-3-3-Hello-World.md` to publish a blog post. Add content using markdown, and commit your blog post. This [Markdown Cheatsheet](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/) might come in handy.

Make sure that you include the following at top of each post:
```
---
layout: post
title: Blog Post Title
author: John Doe
date:   2017-06-15 10:59:56 -0500
comments: true
categories: healthcare
---
```
You can turn off Disqus comments by setting `comments: false`. Additionally, you can add multiple tags to your post, for example: `categories: tag1 tag2`

## Local Development

1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Clone down the repo.
3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`
4. View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
5. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.
